## Custom Lenses for the AWS Well-Architected Tool

- What is AWS Well-Architected?

  - The AWS Well-Architected Framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. 
  
  - AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. 
  
  - Built around six pillars
      - Operational excellence, 
      
      - Security, 
      
      - Reliability, 
      
      - Performance efficiency, 
      
      - Cost optimization, and 
      
      - Sustainability
  
  - AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

- What is AWS Well-Architected tool?
  
  - The AWS WA Tool is designed to help you review the state of your applications and workloads, and provide a central place for architectural best practices and guidance. 
  
  - The AWS WA Tool is based on the AWS Well- Architected Framework, which was developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructures. 
  
  - AWS solutions architects have used the Framework in tens of thousands of workload reviews, and it provides a consistent approach for evaluating your cloud architecture and implementing designs that will scale with your application needs over time.
  
  - You can review workloads against best practices across the architectural pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. 
  
  - The AWS WA Tool delivers a list of issues found in your workloads and step-by-step guidance to make improvements. 
  
  - You can also view the issues found across the portfolio of workloads. We recommend performing a workload review at major milestones in your development cycle.

- What is Custom Lenses for the AWS Well-Architected Tool?
  
  - In addition to the standard guidance provided by the AWS WA Framework and AWS developed lenses, the AWS WA Tool allows now you to add specific best practice guidance using custom lenses. 
  
  - By developing your own questions and evaluating your workloads using your organizationâ€™s best practices, you can perform reviews based on technology or governance requirements specific to your industry.
  
- Benefits of leveraging AWS Well-Architected Tool
  
  - Access knowledge and best practices used by AWS solutions architects whenever you need it. Answer questions about your application or workload, and the AWS WA Tool delivers an action plan with step-by-step guidance on areas for improvement.
  
  - The AWS WA Tool provides a single tool and consistent process to review and measure your cloud architectures. The tool allows you to monitor the status of multiple workloads across your organization and helps you understand potential risks. With the action plan, you can identify next steps for improvement, drive architectural decisions, and build for the cloud with confidence.
  
  - The AWS WA Tool supports continuous improvement throughout the workload lifecycle. The tool makes it easy to save point-in-time milestones and track changes to your workload. Initiate new reviews as desired to help ensure your architecture improves over time.
  
  - With the AWS WA Tool, you can create custom lenses and share them across your entire organization to measure workloads consistently. Specify rules to help you determine which options can result in a high or medium risk, and provide guidance on resolving those risks.
